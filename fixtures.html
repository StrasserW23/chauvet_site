      <h3>Par</h3>

        <img src="Images/Spot.avif" alt="PAR Light">
        <p>Par lights stand for (Parabolic Aluminized Reflector). These lights are a stage lighting mainstay, famous for being rugged and easy to use. They're most commonly employed for washes and overall lighting, which means they wash the stage or performance space in an even light. That makes them perfect for establishing mood, providing a consistent color tone, or filling big areas without complex programming. PARs are available in multiple beam angles for the designer to choose between tight, concentrated beams or wide diffused coverage. Whether illuminating a concert stage, theater performance, or event backdrop, PAR lights can be relied on to efficiently illuminate the space with light</p>

      <h3>Moving Head Lights</h3>
      <div class="content-pair">
        <img src="Images/Movinghead.jpg" alt="Moving Lights">
        <p>Are some of the strongest and most exhilarating fixtures used in modern lighting design. With the power to pan, tilt, color change, and create any of a wide range of effects, moving heads are tasked with producing dynamic performances where movement and energy are everything. They can sweep beams across audiences, track performers as they move, or be accessed in sync with music for maximum drama. Many moving heads also feature gobos (pattern), prisms, strobe effects, and zooming. Thanks to their flexibility, they're used on anything from stage productions and plays to clubs, festivals, and places of worship. They ignite a show with movement, texture, and precision.</p>

      <h3>LED Bars</h3>
      <div class="content-pair">
        <img src="/Images/Barlights.jpeg" alt="Bar Light">
        <p>Are long, narrow fixtures packed with LED lights that can produce a wide range of colors and effects. They are not normally used to create bright color effects on walls, fades, or accent lighting on walls, risers, or trussing. Their line shape also makes them well suited to edge light stages, outline architectural features, or produce motion effects in a pixel-mapped configuration. LED bars normally comprise three or more controllable zones with the ability to create flowing color patterns, gradients, and chasing effects. They're light-weight, energy-efficient, and adaptable, making them a favorite among set designers, DJs, and production teams alike.</p>

      <h3>Spotlights</h3>
      <div class="content-pair">
        <img src="Images/Spotlight.jpg" alt="Spot Light">
        <p>However spotlights, are more concerned with control and precision. Designed to cast a bright, intense shaft of light upon a narrow space or performer, they're essential whenever you want to command everyone's attention to a particular spot or action. Widely used in theater, concerts, and live oration, spotlights add visual focus and emotional emphasis. Manually operated (follow spots) for some, by a performer-tracked operator, and others automated and programmed to strike precise cues, they have high brightness and sharp cut-offs that penetrate ambient light so the subject is clearly visible no matter how complex the scene.</p>
